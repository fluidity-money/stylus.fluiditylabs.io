# Stylus Tracker

Stylus Tracker is a simple webapp that provides a list of the Stylus contract deployments
on Arbitrum, Arbitrum Sepolia, Superposition, Sanko, and Apechain. It does so with a
ingestor that polls a list of RPCs at regular intervals, looking for events generated by
the precompile. It aggregates this list in a simple CSV that can be requested to be
generated at any time.

Polling takes place once an hour. A new RPC endpoint can be added by making a pull request
and adding to `chains.csv`.

This service is provided for free by [Superposition](https://superposition.so), the
blockchain that pays you to use it.
